# Configuration for creating summary plots across assays.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define how to create an integrated set of line plots and heat maps that summarizes
# antibody escape alongside other assays (eg, functional effects of mutations).

  title: Effects of mutations to spike of SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 on escape from antibodies
  legend: |
    This is is an interactive chart. Mouseover points for details and measurements, and
    use the top zoom bar to zoom in on specific sites. The options at the bottom let you
    only show escape for sites with some minimal functional effect, choose the site
    summary metric, or floor the escape at zero.

    The line plots at top show the escape at each site across all antibodies and for individual
    antibodies, and the heatmaps show the effects of individual mutations on antibody escape or
    functions of the protein.
